    <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph of my awesome webpage. I am learning HTML and having fun!</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>Here, I’m adding some headings, paragraphs, and even an image that you can click!</p>

    <h3>Image Section</h3>
    <p>Below is a clickable image that links to the ALX website.</p>

        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png" alt="ALX Logo" width="200" />
    </a>

    <p>Isn't it cool? Clicking the logo will take you to the official ALX website.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my first webpage — more to come soon!</p>
